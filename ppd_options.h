 * This option allows the user to request a display of the items available

 * requirement 2. This requirement should behave as follows - from the 
 * main menu, the user selects 1 and data should be displayed in the 
 * following format: 

 * Items Menu
 * ----------
 * ID    |Name                |Available |Price

/** This option allows the user to purchase an item from the menu.
 * This function is called from the main menu when the user has
 * finally decided to purchase an item. This function allows the user
 * to pay for their item by collecting money from them, and adjusting
 * balances within the system as appropriate. Change is then given
 * back to the customer, if appropriate. The number of items on hand
 * should also be deducted. You should not allow an item to be
 * purchased if there are 0 or less of that item on hand.
 *
 * Purchase Item 
 * ------------- 
 * Please enter the id of the item you wish to purchase: I0001 
 * You have selected “Meat Pie - Yummy Beef in Gravy surrounded by pastry” 
 * This will cost you $3.50.  
 * Please hand * over the money – type in the value of each note/coin 
 * in cents.
 * Press enter or ctrl-d on a new line to cancel this purchase: You
 * still need to give us $3.50: 200 You still need to give us $1.50:
 * 300 Error: $3.00 is not a valid denomination of money.  You still
 * need to give us $1.50: 500 Thank you. Here is your Meat Pie, and
 * your change of $3.50: $2 $1 50c Please come again soon.
 *
 * After which the user would be returned to the main menu. 
 *
 * When refunding money, you must display each note or coin separately
 * used in the refund and you must ensure that prior to the sale that
 * there is sufficient denominations in the system so that the
 * customer is given the correct change. You must also subtract these
 * coins from the coins array if a sale can take place. Note that
 * coins entered to pay for an item can form part of the change that
 * is given to the customer if that is required to give the customer
 * the smallest amount of change possible. If pdd cannot give correct
 * change then the sale should not occur, and your program should
 * display an appropriate message explaining why. 
 *
 * If the user presses enter or ctrl-d on a new line, refund all the
 * coins/notes they have entered so far and return them to the main
 * menu.

 * mentioned for each file must be maintained and the program must be
 * able to load up your files as easily as it loaded up the files that
 * we have provided you with. Also, at this point, once you have
 * implemented dynamic memory allocation, you must free all memory
 * allocated and exit the program. A program which does everything but
 * exit the program will still lose marks, as much as a program that

 * the Name and Description and Price (a valid amount of money in
 * dollars and cents). The item should then be allocated the default
 * "on hand" value specified in the startup code. The new item id
 * shall have an ‘I’ prepended to it and will be 5  characters long.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * This new meal item will have the Item id of I0006.
 * Enter the item name: Baklava
 * Enter the item description: rich, sweet pastry made of layers of
 * filo filled with chopped nuts and sweetened and held together with
 * syrup or honey.
 * Enter the price for this item: 8.00
