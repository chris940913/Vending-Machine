 *
 * Please note that you are expected to initialise the code in such a way
 * that the code will be easy to maintain. Do not hard code values, and 
 * do not use magic numbers for array indexes etc. You are expected to use
 * good coding practices at all times. Do not hardcode array indexes - 
 * you are expected to write code that is maintainable which in this case 
 * means initialization in a loop. A typedef might assist in making this
 * code more readable.
